- Providing a reference power measurement for the ac power
  - independent of signal bandwidth
  - independent of signal period 
- Measuring ac power by combining measurements of 
  - inverters dc input  power 
  - direct measuremetns of heat losses

## Algorithms for Power Computation

Measurements of active power require the determination of a suitable integration intervall. 
The suitable integration intervall has to be as small as possible for captuirng the dynamics of the active power and
sufficintly long, such that the result provides a given level of accuracy.
