## My research interests center around power measurements in automotive electric drives.
{: .left}

In particular, I am interested in power measurements on the ac side of the inverter, between electric motor and inverter.
I plan to answer the question how accurate power measurements are, considering non-sinusoidal signals resulting from the swithing operation of the inverter.

Topics covered by my work are: 

- field oriented control of permanent magnet synchonous motors, 
- embedded microcontroller, 
- analog and digital signal processing, 
- uncertainty evaluation and 
- calorimetric measurements.
