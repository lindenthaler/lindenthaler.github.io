## My Phd research covers power measurements in automotive electric drives.
{: .left}

In particular, I focused on power measurements on the ac side of the inverter, between electric motor and inverter.
I contributed to the question how accurate power measurements are, considering realistic, non-sinusoidal signals resulting from the switching operation of the inverter.

Topics covered by my work are: 

- field oriented control of permanent magnet synchronous motors, 
- embedded microcontroller, 
- analog and digital signal processing, 
- uncertainty evaluation and 
- calorimetric measurements.

All results were publised within the doctoral thesis "Accurate power measurements in electric drives" in 2018.
